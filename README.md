**Bookmark Downloader for Chrome**

I got bored and decided to aks ChatGPT to write a Chrome extension to download my bookmarks to a plain text file. It's currently under review in the Chrome store. 

**What does it do?** 

It downloads your Chrome bookmarks as a formatted txt file with a _Title_ column and a _URL_ column.
